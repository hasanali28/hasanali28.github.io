Hi, Welcome to my blog. You never know what life has for you. It just feels like yesterday. I was the runner up in a national startup competition and later on, it was funded by renowned VC and Angel. and that was that.

Later in my life, I realised what I wanted to do. Though, around 70% of the world's population haven't figured out what they want to do. It wasn't still comforting. Coming back to self realisation & enlightenment - It was maths that I loved since childhood. I just love solving mathematical problems and I scored 100 marks 3 times in K-12. 
  
  
 S0, now I am on a journey to solve problems through maths ans it has led me to the path of Machine Learning ans Data Science. Let's see where it takes me. I just love it.
